# Two-Digit Addition Without Regrouping

## Visual Place Value Problems
In two-digit addition without regrouping, we can use place value blocks to visualize the addition of each digit separately. For example,

### Example 1: 24 + 13  
- Tens: 20 + 10 = 30  
- Ones: 4 + 3 = 7  
- Total: 30 + 7 = 37 

### Example 2: 32 + 24  
- Tens: 30 + 20 = 50  
- Ones: 2 + 4 = 6  
- Total: 50 + 6 = 56

## Multi-Step Word Problems
These addition scenarios require combining two or more steps using addition, applicable for students to practice.

### Example Problem 1:  
Anna has 14 apples, and she buys 23 more. How many apples does she have now?  
- Step 1: Add 14 + 23 = 37.  
Anna has a total of 37 apples.

### Example Problem 2:  
Tom read 15 pages on Monday and read 27 pages on Tuesday. How many pages did he read in total?  
- Step 1: Add 15 + 27 = 42.  
Tom read a total of 42 pages.

## Equations
Here are some equations to practice two-digit addition without regrouping:
1. 21 + 17 = ?  
2. 34 + 12 = ?  
3. 45 + 20 = ?  

These exercises allow students to gain confidence in adding two-digit numbers without needing to regroup.
